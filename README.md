# RPN-Calculator

This was an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) Calculator I created as part of my Grade 12 Computer Science course.

## Get Started
This application depends on having a standard C++ library, as well as the [AP Classes](https://mathbits.com/MathBits/CompSci/download.htm) and the [Allegro5 Graphics Library](https://liballeg.org/), so you'll need to download those as well, and have installed a MinGW compiler.

## Instructions
[Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) works by entering *arguments* and then an *operator*. For example, pressing "3 4 5 +" is equivalent to the expression "3 + 4 + 5", which would give you 12.
